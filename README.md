# kml-gen
Take information from a text file and generates kml file to use on Google Earth.

The python script will generate `output/KMLGen.kml` file and images of each site. These should be compress on a `.kmz` file to make easier the load of information.

To run the map, the KMZ file should be stored on a webserver.

We included too a Javascript generator, to display the map on Google Maps. The standard output is located on directory `web` .
